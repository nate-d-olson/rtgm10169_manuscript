Hi Nate,
 
Thank you for offering to make the plots in R. Let me know if you have questions about the data.
 
attached:
All original F1data for graphs.xlsx – used to make Fig 3
All original F2 data for graphs.xlsx – used to make Fig 4
2020_05_29_homogeneity_testing_fragment_1_10169.xlsx – used to make Fig 5
2020_06_12_homogeneity_testing_fragment_2_10169.xlsx – used to make Fig 6
March 2022 stability data.xlsx – used to make Fig 7
 
Also – I do have the Illumina data on this computer but I don’t see any QC data besides what I sent 
you earlier. This is all I have in the folder:

 
Is there a particular file type I should be looking for for the QC data?
 
Have a good weekend!
